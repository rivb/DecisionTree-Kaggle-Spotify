# DecisionTree-Kaggle-Spotify

Implementation of sklearn DecisionTreeClassifier to a dataset of 2017 songs with attributes from Spotify's API. Each song is labeled "1" meaning 'like' and "0" for songs 'don't like'. With this model and this dataset, we obtain 76% accuracy for the prediction of whether or not the user will like a song.

For the implementation we used the following links:
